"""Makes two processes interact.

This code can be run as python2 or python3 in most systems. You can use pypy3
as well.

This is a small program that runs two processes, connecting the stdin of each
one to the stdout of the other. It doesn't perform a lot of checking, so many
errors may be caught internally by Python (e.g., if your command line has
incorrect syntax) or not caught at all (e.g., if the judge or solution hangs).

Run this as:

    python interactive_runner.py <cmd_line_judge> -- <cmd_line_solution>

For example, if you have a testing_tool.py in python3 to use as judge -- like
one downloaded from a problem statement -- and you would run your solution
in a standalone using one of the following:

    pypy3 my_solution.py
    ./my_solution
    java Solution
    my_solution.exe

Then you could run the judge and solution together, using this, as:

    python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py -- pypy3 my_solution.py
    python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py -- ./my_solution
    python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py -- java solution
    python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py -- my_solution.exe

Notice that the solution in cases 2, 3 and 4 would usually have a compilation
step before running, which you should run in your usual way before using this
tool.

This is only intended as a convenient tool to help contestants test solutions
locally. In particular, it is not identical to the implementation on our
server, which is more complex.

The standard streams are handled the following way:

- judge's stdin is connected to the solution's stdout;
- judge's stdout is connected to the solution's stdin;
- stderrs of both judge and solution are piped to standard error stream, with
  lines prepended by "judge: " and "  sol: " respectively (note, no
  synchronization is done so it's possible for the messages from both programs
  to overlap with each other).
